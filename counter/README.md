# counter
This is a small project where I built a basic counter application to practice and apply what I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea and core logic were inspired by a tutorial from the YouTube channel Bro Code. I followed the tutorial to understand the fundamentals and then added my own touches to improve and personalize the project.
